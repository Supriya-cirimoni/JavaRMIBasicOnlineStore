# How to RUN
- Make sure you have installed Java before running the code
Server
- Run the program using "make" command.(server machine used here is "in-csci-rrpc02.cs.iupui.edu")
- The port number used 2233
- Later use the command "make server" command.

The client connection must be established once the server connection is established.

Client
- Switch to another terminal for the Client
- Later, connect with the server using the "make clientPerson" command. (I have used another machine for the client "in-csci-rrpc03.cs.iupui.edu")
